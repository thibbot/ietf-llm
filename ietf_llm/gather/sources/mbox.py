    By default, includes the auto-discovered list (looked up from
    Datatracker by WG affinity). `extra_lists` adds further lists
    the WG follows but Datatracker doesn't attribute to it — passed
    in via `--mailing-list` on the CLI. Set `auto_discover=False` to
    skip the Datatracker lookup entirely (used for synthetic / `x-`
    corpora, which have no WG record to look up against). Each list
    keeps its own per-list IMAP cache (`imap-cache/<wg>/<list>/`),
    and the thread-reconstruction walker already picks up every
    `.eml` under `imap-cache/<wg>/` regardless of subdir.

    Returns the list of `raw/mail-archive-<year>.txt` files written.
    Year dumps are merged across all lists — they're for human grep
    / NotebookLM upload, not for indexed retrieval. When `suppress_raw`
    is set those merged dumps are skipped entirely (the per-list IMAP
    `.eml` cache, which is the real efficiency token and the source the
    thread reconstruction reads, is always written); returns []
    accordingly.

    `note_fn`, when given, receives one line per list describing that list's
    outcome (see `_sync_one_list`), plus one for the case where no list is
    configured at all. The gather's own logs already carry these; the notes are
    what makes them visible to a caller reading `gather_status` rather than
    stderr.
